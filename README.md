# Wicked Good News Scraper

A web app that lets the user scrape, view and comment on the latest news from the Boston Herald website. The user has the ability to save a headline into a seperate list to make it easier for them to find and comment on just the articles they want to. 

The scraper provides a link (which opens in a new tab) directly to the article. Once the user reads the article they can add a note about the article for future reference. 

Once that article note is no longer needed, the user can go back and delete that note.

The app can be found here: https://git.heroku.com/limitless-refuge-65651.git
The Boston Hearld site can be found here: https://www.bostonherald.com/
